#Unity UI TranslationIt's a solution for Unity games' translation which use UGUI, created by akyryz at first.##UITL*UnityEngine.UI.Translation* by akyryzThe **Loader**. It's based on [akyryz's **UI Translation Loader**](http://www.anime-sharing.com/forum/requests-releases-123/release-ui-translation-loader-v0-12-3-translation-502649/) (version 0.16).It works with modified *UnityEngine* & *UnityEngine.UI* to dump texts/textures/audios and reload the translated version at runtime.##UITI*UInjector* by UlyssesThe **Injector**. It modifies *UnityEngine* & *UnityEngine.UI* to create a version which can co-operate with the Loader. It aimed to support Unity 5.x.It only support the Loader here and may not support akyryz's new version since I have no idea what he might add into it  :)  and I may add some other things into it later.
