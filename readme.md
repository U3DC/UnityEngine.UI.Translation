#Unity UI Translation

A solution for Unity games (UGUI) translation, created by akyryz at first.

Notice: This is for game translation without the source project. If you are a developer and searching for a solution to use in your own game, this project is not for you.

##UITL

*UnityEngine.UI.Translation* by akyryz

The **Loader**. It's based on [akyryz's **UI Translation Loader**](http://www.anime-sharing.com/forum/requests-releases-123/release-ui-translation-loader-v0-12-3-translation-502649/) (version 0.16).
It works with modified *UnityEngine* & *UnityEngine.UI* to dump texts/textures/audios and reload the translated version at runtime.

TODO: 
- Font support

##UITI

*UInjector* by Ulysses

The **Injector**. It modifies *UnityEngine* & *UnityEngine.UI* to create a version which can co-operate with the Loader. It aims to support Unity 5.x.

It only supports the Loader here and may not support akyryz's new version since I have no idea what he might add into it  :)  and I may add some other things into it later.
